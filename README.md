# Lazy Apps

## Introduction

This repository provides a simple customizable [Nix][] package,
`lazy-app`, that you can use to create a set of applications that
_appear_ to be installed on your system but are actually not until you
try to run them.

This is something of an intermediate step between packages installed
in your system/user profile and packages run through something like
[comma][] or [nix run][].

Note, this is experimental software and it may change at any time in
incompatible ways.

## Usage

Lazy Apps is currently made available as a Nix Flake.

Add

``` nix
lazy-apps = {
  url = "sourcehut:~rycee/lazy-apps";
  inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
};
```

to your Flake inputs. You can then make use of the `lazy-app` package.
For example, installing

``` nix
lazy-apps.packages.${system}.lazy-app.override { pkg = pkgs.hello; }
```

will make the `hello` command available. If a desktop item is
specified then the application will also show up in your desktop
manager. Here is an example for GpsPrune:

``` nix
lazy-apps.packages.${system}.lazy-app.override {
  pkg = pkgs.gpsprune;
  desktopItem = pkgs.makeDesktopItem {
    name = "gpsprune";
    exec = "gpsprune %F";
    icon = "gpsprune";
    desktopName = "GpsPrune";
    genericName = "GPS Data Editor";
    comment = "Application for viewing, editing and converting GPS coordinate data";
    categories = [ "Education" "Geoscience" ];
    mimeTypes = [
      "application/gpx+xml"
      "application/vnd.google-earth.kml+xml"
      "application/vnd.google-earth.kmz"
    ];
  };
}
```

The fields currently available for override are:

`pkg`
: Nix package providing the application. Mandatory.

`exe`
: Name of the command to run. If not given, then `meta.mainProgram` or
  the name of the package is used.

`desktopItem`
: The application desktop item, as generated by
  `pkgs.makeDesktopItem`. Optional.

## Future Improvements

One can imagine additional features and improvements:

- Support for application icons.

- When realizing a package we could place it in a "lazy-apps" profile
  so that it won't get garbage collected.

- A tool that, given a package, can generate corresponding app
  attribute sets.
